# User_Retention_Analysis

Based on research in this repository, a cohort analysis was produced, it can be said that the most users made transactions for the first time in January 2010 as many as 713 people. Then, users who transacted for the first time in January were also the users who transacted the most in the following months with an average retention rate of 40%. However, what must be taken into account is that the number of users who transacted for the first time after January decreased and this resulted in a reduction in retention rates in the following months. Where it can be seen that the retention rate, apart from January, is only around less than 40%. What is quite convincing is that the retention rate in December is the lowest compared to other retention rates.
